# Unexpected CSS Specificity Behavior with Inheritance and Classes

This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS issue related to specificity and inheritance when combining styles from parent elements and class selectors. The bug arises from the unexpected interaction between inheritance, specificity, and class-based styles, potentially leading to unexpected visual results.

## Bug Description

The `bug.css` file contains a CSS snippet exhibiting the problem.  The unexpected behavior relates to how CSS specificity resolves conflicts between inherited styles and styles applied through class selectors. When a class is added to an element already styled by a parent element and a more specific selector, the more specific selector wins, potentially overriding intended style combinations.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file offers a solution that addresses this issue, making the CSS behavior more predictable and consistent with expected styling combinations. The solution involves careful consideration of CSS specificity and potentially using more sophisticated styling techniques to achieve the intended visual results.

## How to reproduce the bug

1.  Clone this repository.
2. Create an HTML file that includes the styles from `bug.css`.
3. Observe how the styling unexpectedly overrides combined class and inheritance-based styling.
4. Compare this behavior to the resolved version in `bugSolution.css`.
