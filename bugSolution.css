One solution is to use the `!important` flag, but this is generally discouraged because of the potential for cascading issues.  A better approach is to reorganize selectors or use a more specific selector in the class.  This is demonstrated below:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green;
}

.special-paragraph {
  color: purple !important; /* or restructure selectors */
}

div .special-paragraph {
  color: orange; 
}
```

Alternatively, restructuring selectors to achieve the desired effect without `!important` might involve using more specific selectors or reorganizing styles to ensure the desired outcome.  The following approach avoids `!important` and directly addresses the specificity issues:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

.special-paragraph {
  color: purple; /* or restructure selectors */
}

div p {
  color: green;
  .special-paragraph {
    color: blueviolet; /* combining green and purple hues */ 
  }
}
div .special-paragraph {
  color: orange; 
}
```

This more clearly separates and manages the specificity, avoiding unintended overrides.
